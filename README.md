# OSS - Vulnerability analyzer


Package managers like NPM and PyPi have made code re-usability easy from open-source repositories. This makes development easy and reduces time to market. But due to the ease of publishing a package, it becomes easy for malicious actors to cause harm to both the developers and the users.

## Problem Statement
Package managers such as NPM have made code re-usability easy from open-source repositories. This makes development easy and reduces time to market. But due to the ease of publishing a package, it becomes easy for malicious actors to cause harm to both the developers and the users.

## Solution

A Web application  that analyzes any NPM package, identifies the genuineness of the package, and indicates whether the package might pose a security threat and also displays the detailed information of vulnerabilities present in the project and displays a safety score.
